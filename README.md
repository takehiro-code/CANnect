# CANnect

Automotive diagnostic application developed as a part of engineering science 2020 capstone group croject. We built the application that diagnoses vehicle performance from On-board diagnostics-II (OBDII) port, and the mobile application displays the performance data with the Bluetooth connection from the hardware module. The dashboard on the mobile app processes the performance data and visualizes it in table, line chart, meter visualization, etc. in real-time. The performance data, which is OBDII parameter IDs (PIDs), includes engine coolant temperature, fuel pressure, engine RPM, vehicle speed, etc.
